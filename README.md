# Airbnb_EDA_Project
This project explores Airbnb data to uncover trends, user behavior, and pricing strategies. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify patterns, anomalies, and outliers that impact host performance and customer preferences. The insights help optimize business strategies, refine marketing efforts, and enhance the overall platform experience.
